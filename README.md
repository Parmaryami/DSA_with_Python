DSA_with_Python

This repository contains my notes, code, and resources from the Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms using Python course offered by Swayam.

Course Overview

The course is an 8-week journey into Python programming, focusing on:

Basic programming concepts (conditionals, loops, functions, lists, strings, tuples)
Searching and sorting algorithms (binary search, merge sort, quicksort)
Data structures (dictionaries, linked lists, binary search trees, heaps, stacks, queues)
Advanced topics (exception handling, file I/O, backtracking, dynamic programming, memoization)
Problem-solving techniques and algorithmic thinking

I learned not only technical concepts but also how to approach problems systematically and optimize solutions effectively. 
The course was engaging, and the structured breakdown of topics helped solidify my Python foundation.

Repository Structure

The repository is organized into subfolders, each corresponding to a week of the course.
